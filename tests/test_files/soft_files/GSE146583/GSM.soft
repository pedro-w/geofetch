Kidney cortices were minced and digested in advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing liberase (Sigma) for 1h at 37 °C. Digested samples were filtered through 40 μm strainers (BD Biosciences) and washed with cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) twice. Finally, samples were resuspended in advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Thermo Fisher Scientific), glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Insulin-transferrin-selenium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 20 ng/ml EGF (R & D Systems), and 100 nM hydrocortisone (Sigma), and plated in dishes.
