!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library amplification was performed using NEB Nex High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (M0541L, NEB) and primer combinations provided in Nextera DNA Library Prep kit.  The library was optimized for enrichment for 100-1000 bps fragments using SPRI beads based size-selection and the quality of the purified DNA library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (2100 Expert software, Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA Chips (5067-4626; Agilent Technologies Inc.). The appropriate concentration of sample was determined using the Qubit Fluorometer (Molecular Probes). Ten 40nM samples were pooled and run on a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (20024907; Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) and the NextSeq 500 Illumina Sequencer to obtain paired end reads of 75 bp.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library amplification was performed using NEB Nex High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (M0541L, NEB) and primer combinations provided in Nextera DNA Library Prep kit.  The library was optimized for enrichment for 100-1000 bps fragments using SPRI beads based size-selection and the quality of the purified DNA library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (2100 Expert software, Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA Chips (5067-4626; Agilent Technologies Inc.). The appropriate concentration of sample was determined using the Qubit Fluorometer (Molecular Probes). Ten 40nM samples were pooled and run on a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (20024907; Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) and the NextSeq 500 Illumina Sequencer to obtain paired end reads of 75 bp.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library amplification was performed using NEB Nex High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (M0541L, NEB) and primer combinations provided in Nextera DNA Library Prep kit.  The library was optimized for enrichment for 100-1000 bps fragments using SPRI beads based size-selection and the quality of the purified DNA library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (2100 Expert software, Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA Chips (5067-4626; Agilent Technologies Inc.). The appropriate concentration of sample was determined using the Qubit Fluorometer (Molecular Probes). Ten 40nM samples were pooled and run on a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (20024907; Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) and the NextSeq 500 Illumina Sequencer to obtain paired end reads of 75 bp.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Briefly 50,000 cells from frozen samples were collected, then placed into lysis buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by Tn5 transposase-mediated tagmentation and adaptor incorporation at sites of accessible chromatin carried out using the Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (FC-121-1030, Illumina) at 37°C for 30 min.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library amplification was performed using NEB Nex High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (M0541L, NEB) and primer combinations provided in Nextera DNA Library Prep kit.  The library was optimized for enrichment for 100-1000 bps fragments using SPRI beads based size-selection and the quality of the purified DNA library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (2100 Expert software, Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA Chips (5067-4626; Agilent Technologies Inc.). The appropriate concentration of sample was determined using the Qubit Fluorometer (Molecular Probes). Ten 40nM samples were pooled and run on a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (20024907; Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) and the NextSeq 500 Illumina Sequencer to obtain paired end reads of 75 bp.
